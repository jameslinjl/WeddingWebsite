      <div class="section col-md-7">
        <p>Shortly after starting their freshman year at Columbia University, Tanni and James met for the first time. Both had gotten involved with Christian Union at Columbia, a ministry and family that would later evolve into Columbia Faith and Action, earlier in the semester, but at that point the men and the women in the group had not crossed the gender barrier and met each other yet. And so at a Christian Union social event in JJ's Place, the two were fatefully introduced... and did not speak a word to each other that night.</p>

        <p>Their first conversation was prompted by Tanni (at the time called "Tatianna" by James) being the sole attendee of a praise and worship night hosted by James. After struggling through finding songs they both knew, they settled on DCB's "How He Loves" (it turned out that Tanni actually quite disliked the song, while James was long under the impression that she loved it). Over the course of the next year, both Tanni and James served in leadership for CFA and grew in mutual admiration, seeing the other's love for Jesus and care for others.</p>

        <p>This admiration gradually grew into attraction which became solidified in commitment on March 31, 2013. James and Tanni greatly enjoyed their time dating, experiencing the ups and downs and ups of learning one another, meeting the other's family, and having adventures both together and at a distance from one another. However, this finally changed on a fateful Sunday in October 2014...</p>

      <div class="section col-md-1"></div>
      <div class="section col-md-7">
        <p>On the bright Sunday afternoon of October 5, Ashley asked Tanni to go to 86th Street with her to check out a cafe as a study break. Somewhat reluctantly, Tanni agreed to go. Little did she expect the surprise that would be waiting for her...</p>
        
        <p>Several months earlier, James began plotting with Ashley and Lilian for that afternoon. Ashley had put together a lovely birthday celebration for Tanni in April, taking a group of us to Cafe Lalo, one of the main scenes from Tanni's favorite film, You've Got Mail. Wanting to continue with this same line of inspiration, James decided that their proposal would be a personal re-make of the movie's ending, where Tom Hanks's character asks Meg Ryan's character to meet in a particular spot of Riverside Park, coincidentally one of Tanni and James's favorite spots in the city, and reveals himself as her secret lover...</p>

        <p>Once Tanni and Ashley emerged from the station at 86th Street, Ashley sent a text to James, who was already pre-positioned with Lilian beside The 91st Street Garden in Riverside Park. James then sent Tanni a text replicating Tom Hanks's message. With a little help from Ashley, Tanni then understood that this was no ordinary movie reference; the two headed towards the garden. After a short solo photoshoot, James emerged from his hidden spot in the wings with daisies and a poem he wrote in hand. He read, he knelt, he asked, and the two embraced as fiance and fiancee.</p>

        <p>The day was wrapped up with a few more photos in the park, a quaint dinner at Jacob's Pickles, and exciting moments of calling friends and family to spread the good news.</p>

      <h2>James Xue, Best Man</h2>
      <p>He is Chinese-American, studies Computer Science, hails from a suburban town about 2 hours from New York City, has a sister who graduated from Johns Hopkins, and loves Jesus; he is James... Xue. After finding out that he shared a rather unusual number of traits with the groom, James subsequently agreed to be the groom's roommate and best friend for every one of their four years at Columbia. In their prime, you could commonly find these two coding, taking late night strolls around campus, and playing basketball at Dodge. Through all of these experiences and more, James has forever shaped the trajectory of the groom's life into one of more love, more serious thought and reflection, and more of God's adventure. James holds bioinformatics and Columbia's Christian A Capella group Jubilation! dear to his heart, and he will be pursuing a PhD and academic career in one of the two (see if you can guess which one!).</p>

      <h2>Karl Li, Best Man</h2>
      <p>Sometime around the 4th grade, when the groom discovered that he possessed a Gameboy Link Cable, Karl became a much cherished friend in the groom's eyes. Little did either of them know that this was the beginning of a special friendship, rivaling the brotherhood of Mario and Luigi, which would mold and shape them both in those formative years. Karl taught the groom how to be transparent before his peers, how NOT to interact with girls back in middle school and high school, and how to love Jesus with fervor and intensity. With Relient K as their muse, Karl and the groom could often be found in the church sanctuary jamming on guitar and bass as well as loving on their Brothers-in-Christ in various ways. Karl is passionate about business, technology, and the Gospel, and he will be in Philadelphia start his labor in tech consulting in the coming months.</p>

      <h2>Dasha Korolev, Maid of Honor</h2>
      <p>Ever since Dasha complemented the bride's hair in their 7th grade algebra class (and promptly invited herself over to the bride's house), the two have been the best of friends. Even a cross-country move for Dasha couldn't stop this friendship - she and the bride enjoyed tying up their household phone lines for hours on end throughout their high school years (to the great dismay of their parents). To this day, they enjoy visiting each other often, going to concerts together, watching Grey's Anatomy, and laughing together over the odder things in life. Dasha has taught the bride much about embracing spontaneity (stillworking on that one!),loving other peoplewholeheartedly, and being open to new interests.Dasha loves learning about archaeology and alchemy, traveling, and enjoying a good cup of coffee with friends. She hopes to join a program in Germany soon to study the management of UNESCO World Heritage sites.</p>

      <div class="guest-bio" id="lilian">
      <h2>Lilian Chow, Maid of Honor</h2>
      <p>Lilian and the bride met in their freshman year at Columbia through their Bible course, after which they agreed to be roommates for the following year. Little did they know that this amicable agreement would blossom into an amazing friendship! Over the past three years as friends and roommates, they have worshipped God and served in ministry together, confided in and encouraged one another, and enjoyed each other's general silliness. Their roommate hobbies include singing terrible duets, watching ABC Family's Switched at Birth, and eating junk food together even when they know they shouldn't. Having seen the bride through all her ups and downs, Lilian has shown her what it's like to be loved and accepted unconditionally. When she's not leading a meeting for one of her many clubs, you can find her watching Taiwanese dramas, playing Candy Crush, and singing or bonding with one of her beloved fellow members of Jubilation!, Columbia's Christian a cappella group. Lilian hopes to work in the field of education, either in the US or in her native Hong Kong.</p>
  <div class="guest-bio" id="wilson">
      <h2>Wilson Hsu, Groomsman</h2>
      <p>Wilson and the groom met a long, long time ago, back in the days of full day Vacation Bible School and Chinese Culture Camp, where slip 'n slides and grappling tournaments were highlights of the summer months. Over the years, Wilson could often be found teaching the groom to breakdance among other athletic and artistic endeavors, getting him to loosen and lighten up, and filling out the rhythm section of Jamwilkarsones with the groom. Their relationship was not always smooth; it had to endure times of intense drama, anger, passion, and compassion. But praise God that He used these moments in His infinite wisdom. Wilson taught the groom about loyalty and resilience, both of which are challenging lessons. When he isn't serving and loving his ROX and Pi Alpha Phi communities, he can be found playing a variety sports or video games; Wilson will be pursuing a career in tech after graduation.</p>

  <div class="guest-bio" id="ryan">
      <h2>Ryan Bae, Groomsman</h2>
      <p>On the first day of college, Ryan was the first member of Carman 204 that the groom encountered. Through his amazing gift of finding free events and discounted excursions in the New York, Ryan brought many adventures to the four members of 204 and beyond. Over their time at Columbia, Ryan and the groom shared countless highs and lows, serious conversations and light-hearted Starcraft matches, and several stints of caring for Ryan's pet turtle (including insane car rides, disappearing before move out, and a cameo at a wedding). He showed the groom what it looks like to bounce back from adversity; in their time together, he displayed and inspired bravery in the face of his personal fears and obstacles. Ryan can often be found tinkering with and dreaming of the next big start up idea as well as enjoying food from around the neighborhood with the groom and others. He loves solving challenging business problems and will be taking his passion for consulting and entrepreneurship out west to California after graduation.</p>

    <div class="guest-bio" id="shayna">
      <h2>Shayna Orens, Bridesmaid</h2>
      <p>Shayna and the bride owe their friendship to a mutual love of Scrabble - they became friends by playing together one night at the pre-orientation program they both attended before their freshman year at Columbia. They continued their friendship in their first-year Western Literature class, in which they doodled and had thought-provoking discussions in equal measure. Since then, Shayna and the bride have enjoyed "studying" together (read: making each other laugh and talking about life), soaking up the meager New York sunshine during the spring, and playing with Shayna's dog, Emma. Shayna continuously inspires the bride to find out what she is passionate about and to try to work for positive change wherever she is. You can find Shayna doing just that - both in her research and travels abroad, and in her efforts at home teaching yoga and being an amazing friend! Shayna will be completing her last year at Columbia this year - and will probably go on to save the world! </p>

      <h2>Grace Fowler, Bridesmaid</h2>
      <p>Grace and the bride started out as bitter rivals, both competing for the same role in a school play. After realizing that they actually kinda liked each other, they became fast friends. Throughout their friendship, they have bonded over shared passions. In middle school, they made their acting debuts together. Both have since realized that their chances at Broadway were few and far between. Luckily, they've both set their eyes on new interests (in the same field yet again!) as Psychology majors! Grace is forever inspiring the bride by her persistence in the midst of trial and her confidence in the things she believes. Together, they enjoy talking about Jesus, feminism, and social justice, and learning fascinating facts about animals by watching PBS documentaries. In her spare time, you can find Grace reading, crafting,or educating others over a meal about the issues she's passionate about. She hopes to become a psychologist, hanging out with as many adorable children as possible along the way.</p>

  <div class="guest-bio" id="luke">
      <h2>Luke Foster, Groomsman</h2>
      <p>In the early days of NSOP, a mutual friend brought Luke to the groom and proceeded to ask the groom to guess where he was from (the guess was Zimbabwe, not far from the reality of Mozambique). On any given day, Luke and the groom could be found frantically pulling off the latest Veritas Forum, gallavanting across Western Europe, dancing to silly music of their youth, and enjoying a pack of Welch's Fruit Snacks together. Luke modeled for the groom intellectual curiousity, care for our culture, and deep appreciation for tradition - and these have certainly made a lasting impact, stretching and challenging the groom in these ways and more. Luke is fascinated by the transformation of society by the Gospel and cannot get enough of people - whether through books or face-to-face conversation. He will be taking time to work before heading off to graduate school and taking the intellectual world by storm.</p>

      <p>On the way to a Yankees game, the first ever CFA event, Xavier and the groom walked down Amsterdam Avenue and chatted about their shared experience playing tenor sax. Little did Xavier know that he would sign away the rights to his afro for the remainder of the year to the groom; little did the groom know that this guy would become one of his dearest friends, consistently providing the groom with laughter and love. Much of their laughter was derived fromg dancing to Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" and accidentally saying offensive words due to speaking in ridiculous accents/voices. Much of the love came from the genuine and heartfelt care that was incredibly evident on both sides. Xavier is a classical music afficionado as well as a francophile; as far as work goes, he will be directing his energy towards a research and academic career in Neuroscience and Biology.</p>

      <h2>Charlotte Lin, Bridesmaid & Sister of the Groom</h2>
      <p>On the first day of the groom's life on earth, Charlotte expressed her disapproval at having to take her new baby brother home with her. Fortunately, relations warmed up between the siblings as the years went on, and the two have truly treasured their shared background, their complementary differences, and their friendship. Over the years, the groom has experienced countless moments of grace from Charlotte, both active (taking time to ask good questions, playing "pretend" with the groom, sharing transparently) and passive (Charlotte being the "experimental" child). More recently, the bride has started to get to know Charlotte as a future sister-in-law, and she is incredibly excited at the prospect of this relationship in the years to come. Charlotte loves to serve her youth group kids and drive in her car, Appa, and she is right in the heart of her studies to become a doctor.</p>

      <h2>Ashley Mendez, Bridesmaid</h2>
      <p>Ashley and the bride first met at Columbia in a pre-orientation program their freshman year. In the overwhelming sea of strange new faces, Ashley as a fellow Christian and California native was an anchor for the bride in her first year of college. They continue to find refuge in each other in their shared faith and sense of humor, and together they enjoy re-watching You've Got Mail for the 500th time, lamenting the cold weather,and searching for decent Mexican food in NYC (a quest yet to be accomplished). Throughout their friendship, the bride has admired Ashley's strength of will and heart in both good times and bad, and her unassuming love for her friends. Ashley's favorite pastimes include exploring the city, particularly Brooklyn (her favorite borough), finding beauty in the everyday (and sharing it with us on Instagram!), and capturing her experiences through photography. Ashley wants to work in crisis management doing what she does best - helping us get our lives together and staying afloat in the midst of chaos.</p>
