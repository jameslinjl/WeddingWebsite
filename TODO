Things still to be done:

- find the "Anna & Bradley" font [DONE, 
    I added the font -- you only will be able to see if it you load the site on a server though 
    (eg. python -m SimpleHTTPServer)
- figure out what to do with bottom white space
- get smooth appearing of text
- frosting and placement of text
- text font and color
- fill in content
- get spacing correct
